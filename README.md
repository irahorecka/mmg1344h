## Course Description

The Foundational Computational Biology (FCB) courses, offered through the Molecular Genetics Graduate program, are taught as two 6-meeting topic courses that cover selected foundational concepts and current applications for computational biology and bioinformatics.  The courses are targeted to 1st year graduate students, with preference given to students in the CBMG track of the Molecular Genetics Graduate Program.

Assignments will be both pen-and-paper and practical assignments requiring programming (e.g., Python) or statistical environments (e.g., R).

Enrollment is subject to Instructor approval, and **will require**:

1) Evidence of comfort with computer programming
2) Excellence in two or more quantitative subjects, which may include: calculus, linear algebra, probability/statistics or other mathematics courses
